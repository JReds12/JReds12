# 👋 Hi, I'm Joseph Redinger

I'm a data analyst and ecological researcher with a background in predator ecology, invasive species science, and database management. At IRIS-UM, I build and maintain SQL- and Python-based data pipelines to support research reporting for member universities across the U.S. I care deeply about conservation and how data can be used to support conservation efforts. My work bridges ecological field research and large-scale analytics — from python telemetry in the Florida Keys to research spending patterns.
